# v0.4.0

- `Mesh` now has a new `origin` field. This shouldn't affect most users as
  it's only exposed through `draw_mesh`.

# v0.3.0

**This release contains breaking changes, most notably around the `GameContext`
and setup of the main game loop.** It's likely most games will be affected, but
the changes needed are very small and should help us a lot in the long run.
**This release also includes new experimental features, which are made
available a bit sooner before the API is stabilized to allow faster
iteration.**

If you run into any issues, please either create an issue on GitHub, or ping
@darth on Discord.

**Read the section about `GameContext` below for more information.** But
in practice you should be able to just figure out how to fix things from
the compile errors and finding a relevant example. The new game setup is
quite a bit simpler and more ergonomic.

**Your game's colors might look slightly different than on v0.2.** This is
because tonemapping is now disabled by default, and the colors you were seeing
previously were incorrect/distorted. If you'd like to go back to exactly what
you had before in v0.2, simply set `game_config_mut().tonemapping_enabled =
true`. This should make the game look _exactly_ the same as before. If you're
using HDR colors and want those to be tonemapped instead of clipping, make sure
to also set this to `true`.

[The full game loop
example](https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy/blob/master/comfy/examples/full_game_loop.rs)
contains a detailed description of how the main loop of Comfy is setup and
shows what the macros expand to. With `v0.3.0` there is no need for lifetimes
or `GameContext` and users are now much more easily able to define their own `main`
without macros.

## No more `GameContext` and lifetimes around `comfy_game!(...)`

**Important: If you were previously implementing your own game loop with
`impl GameLoop for X`, there is an important change where you no longer
have to call `run_early_udpate_stages` and `run_late_update_stages`.**

One of the most controversial topics after Comfy's release was
`GameContext` vs `EngineContext`, and the the associated lifetimes with
`make_context` and overall the amount of boilerplate.

The initial stance was that `GameContext` is a good thing, as it allows more
flexibility and allows users to pass around a single struct. But things have
changed.

**In Comfy `v0.2.0` we moved a lot of things into globals, which made almost all
use cases around `EngineContext` obsolete and unnecessary.** As it is right now,
users shouldn't really need to pass around `EngineContext` anymore unless they
need something highly specific, such as disabling window resizing or changing
mouse behavior throught `winit`'s `Window` that can be accessed through
`c.renderer`. Everything else should be accessible through globals.

There are a few fields left on `EngineContext` that are mainly for internal use
and are mostly pending refactoring/deletion. We haven't odne this yet because
we're using some of it in our games, and doing it slowly allows us to keep our
games running against Comfy's `master` branch basically at all times. This
might seem like a selfish reason, but a big benefit users get from Comfy is
that we're using it to build games, and we're not locked to some older or
special fork version of the engine. In fact, with almost every change I make to
the engine I also update our games (most of the time just using `path` override
at all times) to ensure nothing serious broke, as the examples don't
necessarily cover everything.

TL;DR:

- Make sure to run your game with `--features dev` in development if you're using shaders
  to get hot reload errors displayed in game.
- `simple_game!(...)` should remain largely unaffected.
- Your `comfy_game!(...)` now works around a single type that acts both as a
  state object, as well as the game loop, and that can be passed around.
- `comfy_game!(...)` no longer requires `GameContext`
- `comfy_game!(...)` now accepts a single parameter, a type that implements a
  `GameLoop` trait. [The physics
  example](https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy/blob/master/comfy/examples/physics.rs)
  is a good starting point on how to implement this trait, but it should be
  mostly self-evident.
- `GameLoop` requires `new(c: &mut EngineState) -> Self` constructor, which
  acts as early game initialization.
- `GameLoop` implements a single `update(c: &mut EngineContext)` that ticks every frame.

Note that the `GameLoop` trait requires a `fn new(c: &mut EngineState) -> Self`
constructor, even though it is not theoretically needed if the user defines
their own `main` and doesn't use any macros. This is so that the
`comfy_game!(...)` macro wouldn't fail with cryptic error messages and users
can simply rely on implementing all functions of the `GameLoop` trait.

## User defined fragment shaders with uniforms

Starting from this version Comfy now supports user defined fragment shaders
with custom uniforms. Right now we only support `f32` uniforms, but this will
get expanded relatively soon.

The API is intentionally kept a bit low level and simple, as we already have
some use cases for Comfy via FFI. While this isn't a primary goal of the
engine, it is a use case that should very much remain supported, and as such
we'll try to make the lower level APIs FFI friendly. Higher level wrappers
(e.g. with RAII/Drop trait) will be added afterwards. Users should feel free to
create their own higher level wrappers around Comfy's low level primitives!

New shader related functions (see their individual docstrings & [fragment shader example](https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy/blob/master/comfy/examples/fragment-shader.rs) for more information):

- `create_shader`: Create a new shader from source code.
- `create_reloadable_shader`: Create a new hot reloadable shader from source code & path.
- `update_shader`: Update the source code of a shader. Intended for users who want to hot reload shaders manually.
- `use_shader`: Use a given shader for rendering from now on.
- `use_default_shader`: Switch back to the default shader.
- `set_uniform_f32`: Set a `f32` uniform value.

## Experimental text rendering

Starting with v0.3 comfy will now support its own text rendering in addition to
the previous approach using `egui`'s painter on a fullscreen canvas.

It should be noted that this is currently an experimental feature. It works
fine and we're already starting to use it internally, but the API will most
certainly change, and there are going to be some hardcoded limitations and
bugs.

If you do end up using this, please expect to that you'll have to either fork
comfy or follow the `master` branch in case you run into any problems. The
reason we're introducing this is to avoid perfectionism and keeping features
hidden until they're 100% complete.

Please note that this doesn't mean "shipping shitty features and leaving them
shitty" like some commercial engines do. Think of it more like _beta_ or _early
access_.

## Experimental perspective camera & 3D/2.5D

Much like text rendering, there's also now work towards supporting **very
simple 3D**. By 3D we really mean 2.5D, and by 2.5D we really mean _rotate a
sprite and use a perspective camera_.

Comfy does have a quite flexible `draw_mesh_ex` API already, so those brave enough
could in theory start working on 3D games. But realistically you probably want to hold on
for a little while unless you're ready to dive into the internals.

Right now we only have `rotation_x` for a 3d rotation around the `x` axis
for `draw_sprite_pro/Sprite/AnimatedSprite`. This will be extended over
time, and users can easily implement their own 3d objects with
`draw_mesh`.

## LDTK support

Comfy now has a very simple builtin support for the [LDTK level
editor](https://ldtk.io/). This isn't very comprehensive yet, and it probably
does much less than you would expect it to do, but there are a few nice things!

Firstly, LDTK officially provides a [generated `serde`
parser](https://ldtk.io/files/quicktype/LdtkJson.rs) for its file format. This
is great in some ways, but [`serde`](https://serde.rs/)'s procedural macros are
_incredibly_ slow to compile, and could easily add seconds to your incremental
builds if you end up triggering a rebuild of the quicktype file.

This is especially noticable if you tried to do something like
`serde_json::from_str::<LdtkJson>(...)` in your crate. In my testing this
easily takes a <1s build to 3-5 seconds alone.

A solution is surprisingly simple, we just need to define a non-generic
function that wraps serde's generic deserializer and move it into its own
crate, meaning all the ugliness that happens with serde's types happen in the
crate, and it won't be triggered on incremental builds. Comfy can now define
the following function which really just calls serde, and this takes the build
time back to <1s quite comfortably. I haven't really noticed a significant
measurable difference with using LDTK this way compared to not using it.

```rust
pub fn parse_ldtk_map(
    map: &str,
) -> Result<quicktype::LdtkJson, serde_json::Error> {
    serde_json::from_str(map)
}
```

It would be interesting to see how this would compare with
[`nanoserde`](https://docs.rs/nanoserde/latest/nanoserde/), which is
_significantly faster to compile than serde_, but it would require some changes
to the generated LDTK file and we just haven't had the time to do those yet.
That being said, Comfy would like to move away from serde in the near if at all
possible.

On top of this, we also provide a few extension traits for LDTK's types that
make working with it a little more convenient. Please keep in mind that LDTK
support is still very early, and you are expected to do digging into LDTK's
file format if you are to use this. That being said, LDTK is very well documented
and while it does have a learning curve it's realtively easy and simple.

## Other changes

- Tonemapping is now disabled by default. You can re-enable it by
  `game_config_mut().tonemapping_enabled = true`. This was done because most
  users aren't using HDR lighting, but the current default tonemapping curve
  will affect all colors in an undesirable way. If you'd like to preserve the
  look of your game from `v0.2` as it was exactly, simply set
  `tonemapping_enabled = true` and don't worry about this :)
- Blood canvas z-index is now configurable in `GameConfig`.
- Removed `(COMFY ENGINE)` from the title. This is now only shown in `--features dev`
  where `(Comfy Engine DEV BUILD)` is appended to the title. This can be useful for tiling
  window managers like i3 to automatically float windows with this title, e.g.
  `for_window [title=".*Comfy Engine DEV BUILD.*"] floating enable`.
- Notable upgrades: `wgpu 0.16.3 -> 0.18.0`, `egui 0.22.0 -> 0.24.1`. The
  `egui` upgrade is somewhat important, as `egui::plot` got moved into a
  separate `egui_plot` crate that Comfy now re-exports.
- Added `--feature git-version` that embeds the current git commit hash
  into the binary at build time. Note that this will make compilation fail
  if `cargo build` is run without there being any git history. See [the
  version
  example](https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy/blob/master/comfy/examples/version.rs)
  for details.
- Removed `--feature lua` and `mlua` integration. This was mainly a remnant of NANOVOID
  but was never implemented properly and missed a lot of bindings. If we do end up wanting
  to have official `mlua` bindings I'd rather that be done in a more principled approach
  where we make sure things are exported in a consistent way.
- Removed `to_despawn` queue from `EngineContext` & `EngineState`, this
  means `c.despawn()` -> `despawn()`, and `c.to_despawn` ->
  `take_to_despawn()`, which now consumes the despawn queue and returns a
  `Vec<Entity>` that are to be despawned by the game.
- Moved `c.draw` into a global, meaning `c.draw_mut()` -> `draw_mut()`.
  Note that this API is likely going to change in the future, and is
  mainly intended for debugging. It's also likely that it'll be removed
  altogether in the future.
- Camera deadzone is now properly configurable with
  `main_camera_mut().deadzone_width/height`. To use this, simply set
  `main_camera_mut().target = vec2(...)` on every frame and the camera
  will do the right thing. Just to clarify, make sure you're not setting
  `.center` as well, as that will get updated based on `.target`.
- Remove `desired_center` for camera, use `target` instead.

Overall many things that were previously undocumented are now documented.

We're also introducing experimental render targets. This is a feature that
isn't yet complete, and there are some issues with it, but since merging it
doesn't really affect/break existing code it'll be included in v0.3 so that we
don't end up with long running feature branches for no reason. [There is an
example showcasing how this feature will
work](https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy/blob/render-targets/comfy/examples/render-target.rs),
but it's very likely we'll have breaking changes around this API, and would
like to discourage people from depending on this functionality in any way for
now. But do feel free to play around with it!

# v0.2.0

The main change in this release is that `EngineContext` is not necessary to
pass around anymore. This should simplify a lot of the confusion, as the #1
question about Comfy from _many_ people was about `GameContext` and
`EngineContext` and why are there two any why do we even need them.

Since Comfy already uses globals for many things, it makes sense to just
embrace this fully and move the remaining things to globals as well. Many
of the values provided in `EngineContext` were already available through
globals and just re-exported, so this shouldn't be a huge issue.

Comfy will still use `EngineContext` internally for some things, but this
won't be re-exported to the users as everything should be accessible by
other means.

List of removed things and where to find them now:

- `c.delta` -> `delta()`. This is likely going to be something that most users
  (including us) will re-export into their `GameContext/GameState` anyway.
- `c.world()` -> `world()`. ECS world already lived in a single instance, it's
  now moved into a single global.
- `c.commands()` -> `commands()`. Same as above.
- `c.cooldowns()` -> `cooldowns()`. This might be worth re-exporting into
  `GameContext` if accessed frequently, but in either way there's no extra
  overhead compared to before.
- `c.mouse_world` -> `mouse_world()`. This already existed before, and may
  also be worth re-exporting anyway.
- `c.egui` -> `egui()`. Note that before this was a field, now it's a
  global function. Though in this case `egui::Context` is already
  internally `Arc<Mutex<ContextImpl>>`, so this function is actually very
  cheap to call as it just returns a `&'static egui::Context` :)
- `c.egui_wants_mouse` -> `egui().wants_pointer_input()`
- `c.config` -> `game_config()` and `game_config_mut()`.
- `c.cached_loader.borrow_mut()` -> `cached_loader_mut()` (for `&` just
  omit `_mut`).
- similarly `c.changes.borrow_mut()` -> `changes()` and `c.notifications.borrow_mut()` -> `notifications()`.
  The last three were undocumented and are not really intended for public
  use yet, but documenting them here anyway.

NOTE: Comfy still includes many APIs which are not currently documented but are
still exposed. The current goal is to work through codebase and cleanup some
odd bits and document them at the same time. If you find something that is not
mentioned on the website or any examples, it's very likely to change in the
future.

As a secondary note, it should be noted that comfy is still _very early_ on in
its lifecycle. Comfy will do its best not to break existing games, but we may
need to iterate on some ideas, and some of them might be controversial, such
as the use of globals.

Comfy is not a project ran by RFCs, and while we do appreciate feedback, some
things have to be figured out by actually using the tool to build games,
running benchmarks, and making decisions based on real world usage.

In our usage of Comfy we've found many things that many in the Rust community
would consider "bad ideas" to be incredible boosts in ergonomics and
productivity. This is something that seems to happen more often than not, and
as such we're not really afraid to make changes like the above where a large
portion of the state is moved into globals. If you find the above change
unacceptable and what we had before "good", maybe take a look at the source
code and see how many globals we already had :)

That being said, the #1 priority of Comfy is and always will be making real
games. If any changes we make become problematic _in real world use cases_,
please do report these. If you think something is slow, please submit a
benchmark showing this. Comfy has enough examples using all of the systems, and
a builtin integration with Tracy, so it should be easy to extend. We do care
about reasonable games performing well on consumer hardware, but we do not care
about being the fastest at rendering 500k particles.

Our own games are not locked behind on an ancient version of Comfy, and we're
doing our best to stay up to date with the latest changes, to make sure things
are actually working smoothly.

## Bloom

Comfy `v0.1.0` had bloom turned on by default. This turned out to be quite
problematic on older integrated GPUs as some users reported, as the builtin
bloom does 20 blur passes :)

In `v0.2.0` bloom is now turned off by default. You can still enable it by
calling `game_config_mut().bloom_enabled = true;`. There's also a [new
example](https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy/blob/master/comfy/examples/bloom.rs)
that showcases bloom and how it can be configured.

## Chromatic aberration

Comfy `v0.1.0` also had chromatic aberration enabled by default, but
considering this isn't even a documented feature and the API for using it is
quite ugly we turned it off for now in `v0.2.0`. I don't think there's any
chance anyone actually used it, but if you did, it'll come back soon I promise.

Post processing is one of the things that should improve after `v0.2.0` is out,
and we'll be able to add more effects and make them easier to use.

## Minor changes:

- `GameConfig` is no longer `Copy`. This shouldn't really affect anyone in
  any way, as it was behind a `RefCell` anyway.

## Next up

The global namespace is currently polluted by a lot of things. The next
`v0.3.0` release will focus on cleaning this up and making some things more
directly accessible (e.g. some globals which are now currently not public).
